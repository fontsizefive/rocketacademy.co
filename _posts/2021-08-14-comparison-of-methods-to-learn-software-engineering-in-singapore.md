Do you dream of becoming a programmer? Or perhaps you are planning a career switch to fulfill a lifelong goal of being a software developer. Regardless, anyone can learn software engineering and achieve a rewarding career in the field.

Obtaining a degree in Computer Science is one way, but there are other methods to learn software engineering even after tertiary education. The three most common ones are: self-learning, bootcamps, and postgraduate programmes like diplomas and Masterâ€™s degrees.

Gain insight into the tertiary and post-tertiary ways of learning software engineering at a glance, and review each method in detail below.
