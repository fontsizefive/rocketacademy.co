In the last few years, Singapore has rapidly become a hub for tech companies and startups. Big businesses and organizations from the US and China are establishing their base in the so-called Silicon Valley of Asia.

<br>

If you’re looking to join the tech industry or take up a software engineer or coder role, the timing couldn’t have been better. The industry is booming, and there’s a high demand for professionals in data science, product management, software engineering, and many other IT fields.

<br>

However, before entering the industry, you will have to face several questions.

<br>

**What field within IT should I choose? What companies offer jobs in that field? Is there a scope of growth in that field or company? Will it be a high-paying job?**

<br>

You’ll have all these questions and more. But lucky for you, we’ve got answers to them. We’ll take you through everything you need to know about the IT industry in Singapore, myths around the industry, the most popular jobs, the skills they require, and more!

<br>

And with this, you can make an informed decision about picking a career option. So let’s dive in!

<br>

## Quick Facts

<br>

● Since 2018, [80 of the top 100](https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/business-insights/insights/singapore-flexes-its-standing-as-asias-technology-capital.html) tech firms in the world have established a presence in Singapore. These include IBM, Google, Microsoft, and several others.

● Companies with immense growth rates, such as Zoom, Twitter, Paypal, ByteDance, etc., have also established offices in Singapore.

● [7000 people were placed](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/2020/1124-jobs-situation-report) in the tech sector between April and November in 2020.

● There are over [12000 job openings](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/2020/1124-jobs-situation-report) present in the tech sector, offering good salaries.

● [30%](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/2020/1124-jobs-situation-report) of the roles do not require core tech knowledge, such as programming, coding, software development, etc.

<br>

All these facts point to the simple fact that a tech career has boundless scope. You can grow both professionally and financially while being at the center of innovation and development.

<br>

However, there are two primary things to note here. First, there are non-tech jobs in the tech industry that balance out the tech-savvy roles such as data scientist, AI specialist, software developer, etc. Second, you might have perceptions that you need a degree to get into a tech role and several others. But that’s not true in most cases.

<br>

This brings us to the myths around the Singapore IT industry. So let us help you by listing down some of the most common misconceptions about the tech industry.

<br>

## Myths About The Industry

<br>

#### **Myth #1: You need to have a tech background to enter the IT industry**

<br>

There are jobs such as product management, business analyst, etc. that require relatively less knowledge about coding than tech-first roles in many companies.

Furthermore, even if you are looking for entry-level tech roles or even mid-career switches, you can still get a job. This is because degree, in most cases, is not the criteria. Instead, the companies focus on your skill sets and passion.

You can leverage your transferable skills, such as analytical thinking, problem-solving, etc., to get a job. In contrast, you can learn technical skills such as coding and development via online coding courses and boot camps.

<br>

#### **Myth #2: Mature employees cannot enter the IT industry**

<br>

As mentioned earlier, you can switch careers and get into the IT industry in both tech and non-tech roles. All you need are the relevant skills to bag you that job you are looking for.

<br>

#### **Myth #3: You need to be good at math**

<br>

This is a surprising one, but no, it isn’t true. In fact, many of the tech/non-tech roles do not even involve mathematics, let alone requiring you to be good at it.

<br>

#### **Myth #4: You’ll only have a promising career if you join a FAANG company**

<br>

The FAANG companies are Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google. People believe that you need to get into big companies such as those listed above to have an impeccable career. However, that’s far from true. These are merely two extremes. In between them, there are various big companies offering you a great career, and there are numerous rapidly growing startups offering good salaries and incredible learning experiences.

<br>

#### **Myth #5: Getting a degree is enough to guarantee you a job**

<br>

IT as an industry is ever-evolving. What you learn when you get a degree are the mere basics. When you enter the industry and work in real-time, you need to keep learning as you go forward.

<br>

If your question is how, then the answer is simple. Subscribe to online courses or join coding boot camps that are present on the internet. These can keep you updated with the latest trends, and you can apply your learnings from here in your job.

<br>
