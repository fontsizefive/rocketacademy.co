intro_paragraph: There are four common ways of becoming a software engineer in Singapore. Obtaining a university degree in Computer Science is perhaps the most traditional, though time-consuming, route to becoming a software engineer. We outline key considerations to help you decide if this course of study is right for you.

#### 1. Sound theoretical understanding, though time-consuming

Computer Science graduates have the longest study duration, though courses typically offer a good theoretical foundation. Many Computer Science graduates also perform well at work in the long-term because of their foundations in theoretical computer science. This helps them solve more complex problems as more senior software engineers.

#### 2. Less practical exposure

Courses usually include two to three software-related internships for practical exposure. This practical exposure is often less than that of bootcamp graduates and self-learners, whose focus is on learning practical skills.

#### 3. Appealing qualification for entry-level jobs

Computer Science graduates are the most in-demand for entry-level roles. Recruiting departments of bigger tech companies tend to screen explicitly for Computer Science university degrees, because that applicant pool tends to be more competitive with stronger candidates overall.

#### 4. Institution reputation matters

A Computer Science graduate from a less reputable university may not perform as well as a bootcamp graduate with a non-Computer Science degree from a top university. Outcomes across all methods of learning software engineering discussed in this article are generally closely correlated with past performance, even though they may be some outliers.

#### 5. Less practical for career switchers

If youâ€™re looking to transition industries, undertaking a four-year university degree may be a costly and time-consuming endeavour. Many career switchers instead choose to learn basic coding or programming through coding bootcamps.
